.SH "NAME"
Font::TTF::GPOS \- Support for Opentype GPOS tables in conjunction with TTOpen
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1GPOS\s0 table is one of the most complicated tables in the \s-1TTF\s0 spec and the
corresponding data structure abstraction is also not trivial. While much of the
structure of a \s-1GPOS\s0 is shared with a \s-1GSUB\s0 table via the Font::TTF::Ttopen
.SH "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
.IX Header "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
Here we describe the additions and lookup specific information for \s-1GPOS\s0 tables.
Unfortunately there is no one abstraction which seems to work comfortable for
all \s-1GPOS\s0 tables, so we will also examine how the variables are used for different
lookup types.
.PP
The following are the values allowed in the \s-1ACTION_TYPE\s0 and \s-1MATCH_TYPE\s0 variables:
.IP "\s-1ACTION_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "ACTION_TYPE"
This can take any of the following values
.RS 4
.IP "a" 8
.IX Item "a"
The \s-1ACTION\s0 is an array of anchor tables
.IP "o" 8
.IX Item "o"
Offset. There is no \s-1RULE\s0 array. The \s-1ADJUST\s0 variable contains a value record (see
later in this description)
.IP "v" 8
.IX Item "v"
The \s-1ACTION\s0 is a value record.
.IP "p" 8
.IX Item "p"
Pair adjustment. The \s-1ACTION\s0 contains an array of two value records for the matched
two glyphs.
.IP "e" 8
.IX Item "e"
Exit and Entry records. The \s-1ACTION\s0 contains an array of two anchors corresponding
to the exit and entry anchors for the glyph.
.IP "l" 8
.IX Item "l"
Indicates a lookup based contextual rule as per the \s-1GSUB\s0 table.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\s-1MATCH_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MATCH_TYPE"
This can take any of the following values
.RS 4
.IP "g" 8
.IX Item "g"
A glyph array
.IP "c" 8
.IX Item "c"
An array of class values
.IP "o" 8
.IX Item "o"
An array of coverage tables
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.PP
The following variables are added for Attachment Positioning Subtables:
.IP "\s-1MATCH\s0" 4
.IX Item "MATCH"
This contains an array of glyphs to match against for all \s-1RULES.\s0 It is much like
having the same \s-1MATCH\s0 string in all \s-1RULES.\s0 In the cases it is used so far, it only
ever contains one element.
.IP "\s-1MARKS\s0" 4
.IX Item "MARKS"
This contains a Mark array consisting of each element being a subarray of two
elements:
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1CLASS\s0" 8
.IX Item "CLASS"
The class that this mark uses on its base
.IP "\s-1ANCHOR\s0" 8
.IX Item "ANCHOR"
The anchor with which to attach this mark glyph
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The base table for mark to base, ligature or mark attachment positioning is
structured with the \s-1ACTION\s0 containing an array of anchors corresponding to each
attachment class. For ligatures, there is more than one \s-1RULE\s0 in the \s-1RULE\s0 array
corresponding to each glyph in the coverage table.
.RE
.PP
Other variables which are provided for informational purposes are:
.IP "\s-1VFMT\s0" 4
.IX Item "VFMT"
Value format for the adjustment of the glyph matched by the coverage table.
.IP "\s-1VFMT2\s0" 4
.IX Item "VFMT2"
Value format used in pair adjustment for the second glyph in the pair
.SS "Value Records"
.IX Subsection "Value Records"
There is a subtype used in \s-1GPOS\s0 tables called a value record. It is used to adjust
the position of a glyph from its default position. The value record is variable
length with a bitfield at the beginning to indicate which of the following
entries are included. The bitfield is not stored since it is recalculated at
write time.
.IP "XPlacement" 4
.IX Item "XPlacement"
Horizontal adjustment for placement (not affecting other unattached glyphs)
.IP "YPlacement" 4
.IX Item "YPlacement"
Vertical adjustment for placement (not affecting other unattached glyphs)
.IP "XAdvance" 4
.IX Item "XAdvance"
Adjust the advance width glyph (used only in horizontal writing systems)
.IP "YAdvance" 4
.IX Item "YAdvance"
Adjust the vertical advance (used only in vertical writing systems)
.IP "XPlaDevice" 4
.IX Item "XPlaDevice"
Device table for device specific adjustment of horizontal placement
.IP "YPlaDevice" 4
.IX Item "YPlaDevice"
Device table for device specific adjustment of vertical placement
.IP "XAdvDevice" 4
.IX Item "XAdvDevice"
Device table for device specific adjustment of horizontal advance
.IP "YAdDevice" 4
.IX Item "YAdDevice"
Device table for device specific adjustment of vertical advance
.IP "XIdPlacement" 4
.IX Item "XIdPlacement"
Horizontal placement metric id (for Multiple Master fonts \- but that is all I know!)
.IP "YIdPlacement" 4
.IX Item "YIdPlacement"
Vertical placement metric id
.IP "XIdAdvance" 4
.IX Item "XIdAdvance"
Horizontal advance metric id
.IP "YIdAdvance" 4
.IX Item "YIdAdvance"
Vertical advance metric id
