.SH "NAME"
Font::TTF::GDEF \- Opentype GDEF table support
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1GDEF\s0 table contains various global lists of information which are apparantly
used in other places in an OpenType renderer. But precisely where is open to
speculation...
.SH "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
.IX Header "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
There are up to 5 tables in the \s-1GDEF\s0 table, each with their own structure:
.IP "\s-1GLYPH\s0" 4
.IX Item "GLYPH"
This is an Font::TTF::Coverage Class Definition table containing information
as to what type each glyph is.
.IP "\s-1ATTACH\s0" 4
.IX Item "ATTACH"
The attach table consists of a coverage table and then attachment points for
each glyph in the coverage table:
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1COVERAGE\s0" 8
.IX Item "COVERAGE"
This is a coverage table
.IP "\s-1POINTS\s0" 8
.IX Item "POINTS"
This is an array of point elements. Each element is an array of curve points
corresponding to the attachment points on that glyph. The order of the curve points
in the array corresponds to the attachment point number specified in the \s-1MARKS\s0
coverage table (see below).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\s-1LIG\s0" 4
.IX Item "LIG"
This contains the ligature caret positioning information for ligature glyphs
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1COVERAGE\s0" 8
.IX Item "COVERAGE"
A coverage table to say which glyphs are ligatures
.IP "\s-1LIGS\s0" 8
.IX Item "LIGS"
An array of elements for each ligature. Each element is an array of information
for each caret position in the ligature (there being number of components \- 1 of
these, generally)
.RS 8
.IP "\s-1FMT\s0" 12
.IX Item "FMT"
This is the format of the information and is important to provide the semantics
for the value. This value must be set correctly before output
.IP "\s-1VAL\s0" 12
.IX Item "VAL"
The value which has meaning according to \s-1FMT\s0
.IP "\s-1DEVICE\s0" 12
.IX Item "DEVICE"
For \s-1FMT\s0 = 3, a device table is also referenced which is stored here

.IP "\s-1MARKS\s0" 4
.IX Item "MARKS"
This class definition table defines the classes of mark glyphs that can be selected
for processing using the MarkAttachmentType field of lookup \s-1FLAG\s0 words.
.IP "\s-1MARKSETS\s0" 4
.IX Item "MARKSETS"
Contains an array of coverage tables indexed by the \s-1FILTER\s0 value of a lookup.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.ie n .SS "$t\->read"
.el .SS "\f(CW$t\fP\->read"
.IX Subsection "$t->read"
Reads the table into the data structure
.ie n .SS "$t\->out($fh)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$t\fP\->out($fh)"
.IX Subsection "$t->out($fh)"
Writes out this table.
.ie n .SS "$t\->\fBminsize()\fP"
.el .SS "\f(CW$t\fP\->\fBminsize()\fP"
.IX Subsection "$t->minsize()"
Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this, then the table
must be bad and should be deleted or whatever.
.ie n .SS "$t\->update"
.el .SS "\f(CW$t\fP\->update"
.IX Subsection "$t->update"
Sort \s-1COVERAGE\s0 tables.
