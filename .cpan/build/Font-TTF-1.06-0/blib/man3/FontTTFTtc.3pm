.SH "NAME"
Font::TTF::Ttc \- Truetype Collection class
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
A TrueType collection is a collection of TrueType fonts in one file in which
tables may be shared between different directories. In order to support this,
the \s-1TTC\s0 introduces the concept of a table being shared by different TrueType
fonts. This begs the question of what should happen to the ' \s-1PARENT\s0' property
of a particular table. It is made to point to the first directory object which
refers to it. It is therefore up to the application to sort out any confusion.
Confusion only occurs if shared tables require access to non-shared tables.
This should not happen since the shared tables are dealing with glyph
information only and the private tables are dealing with encoding and glyph
identification. Thus the general direction is from identification to glyph and
not the other way around (at least not without knowledge of the particular
context).
.SH "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
.IX Header "INSTANCE VARIABLES"
The following instance variables are preceded by a space
.IP "fname (P)" 4
.IX Item "fname (P)"
Filename for this TrueType Collection
.IP "\s-1INFILE\s0 (P)" 4
.IX Item "INFILE (P)"
The filehandle of this collection
.PP
The following instance variable does not start with a space
.IP "directs" 4
.IX Item "directs"
An array of directories (Font::TTF::Font objects) for each sub-font in the directory
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "Font::TTF::Ttc\->open($fname)"
.IX Subsection "Font::TTF::Ttc->open($fname)"
Opens and reads the given filename as a TrueType Collection. Reading a collection
involves reading each of the directories which go to make up the collection.
.ie n .SS "$c\->read"
.el .SS "\f(CW$c\fP\->read"
.IX Subsection "$c->read"
Reads a Collection by reading all the directories in the collection
.ie n .SS "$c\->find($direct, $name, $check, $off, $len)"
.el .SS "\f(CW$c\fP\->find($direct, \f(CW$name\fP, \f(CW$check\fP, \f(CW$off\fP, \f(CW$len\fP)"
.IX Subsection "$c->find($direct, $name, $check, $off, $len)"
Hunts around to see if a table with the given characteristics of name, checksum,
offset and length has been associated with a directory earlier in the list.
Actually on checks the offset since no two tables can share the same offset in
a TrueType font, collection or otherwise.
.ie n .SS "$c\->\s-1DESTROY\s0"
.el .SS "\f(CW$c\fP\->\s-1DESTROY\s0"
.IX Subsection "$c->DESTROY"
