# CONTRIBUTING

## Fixed folders

Except for the following folders, these unlisted folders should not be changed, under any circumstances, because these are created by GNU, and should be stored in there as the rest-overs.

* `.admin` - Admin folder, for further changing in the repo
* `.github` - Containing  GitHub-related files and actions.
* `.gnu-windows` - Including sources and build instructions. May can change to compatible with the installation
* `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `*.md`, `dockerfile`, and `LICENSE` are all generated by GitHub Actions workflows or manually written.
* `.gitmodules` contains all settings of Git submodules.

## Changes in repo layout and updating versions and tools

For in-repo layout and updating versions and tools, please run `.admin/run_admin.sh` with changes variables.

Once it's done, make sure you move all extracted folders into the main repo, remove all compressed files, and also update versioning, paths, and build instructions in `.gnu-windows/build.sh`

## Building the repo

> :warning: Warning
>
> Because an unknown error was detected in the Windows Subsystem for Linux while checking the suffix of binaries, we recommend you build the repo in Linux or use Docker Desktop within Hyper-V.

### Building within Docker

You need to run the pre-defined Docker image, mount your cloned GitHub repo, and build from that. Since GNU Windows use Git Submodules distribution system, it is recommended that you have to update all submodules

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tfslabs/gnu-windows.git
cd gnu-windows
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Replace `<your path>` with your real path to the local repo. Double-quote is needed if there are spaces in your path.

```shell
docker run -it -v <your path>:/root shiroinekotfs/gnu-windows:latest bash
```

Once you're in the `bash`, try this command:

```shell
/root/.gnu-windows/build.sh
```

Once it's done, you'll see your GNU application is building in folder `.gnu-windows\bootstrap`

> If you've got an error of unable to execute of `configure`, or the `build.sh` itself, try deleting that GNU Windows repo, and cloning using a Linux distro. 
>
> WSL or Docker are good for that cloning task, but you cannot use WSL to build the binaries for you.

### Building within Linux

Make sure you've installed all of these packages before building GNU Windows (Debian distros are recommended)

```bash

    fontconfig-config fonts-dejavu-core g++-12 gcc-12 libalgorithm-diff-perl \

    python3-venv file mingw-w64-x86-64-dev mingw-w64-i686-dev mingw-w64-tools
```

Just run the `<your path>/.gnu-windows/build.sh` directly, without changing the current console directory. Don't forget to use `chmod` command.

In case you cannot configure any of above packages, try to find the alternative packages based on your distribution.
